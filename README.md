# nTags README

nTags (Navigational Tags) is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help you efficiently navigate and manage your codebase using customizable tags. With nTags, you can create and manage tags for functions, classes, variables, and more, and organize them with namespaces for better categorization.

## Features

- **Robust Tagging**: Tag various code elements such as functions, classes, variables, conditional statements, loops, imports, and custom code blocks.
- **Namespace Support**: Organize tags with namespaces for better categorization (e.g., `user:cameron`, `feature:cards`).
- **Accurate and Dynamic**: Seamless integration with Git ensures that tags remain accurate and up-to-date across code changes.
- **Real-time and Historical Tracking**: Provides real-time updates to tags as code is edited and committed. Maintains historical tracking of tags, allowing developers to view tags as they were at any point in the projectâ€™s history.
- **Tag View**: A dedicated Tags View panel to browse and manage your tags. Displays nested folders and files, and supports right-click context menus similar to the Explorer view.
